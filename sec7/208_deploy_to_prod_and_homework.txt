To deploy your app to heroku, first check git status to ensure you don't have any uncommitted code, if you do, make a commit.

Then deploy to heroku:

$ git push heroku master

Then run any pending migrations in heroku:

$ heroku run rails db:migrate

Dont forget to post a link to your heroku app in the discussion area! This step is very important since others will get to see your app and get inspired/test.

Homework assignment:

1. Create integration test for signing up a user.

2. Create integration test for creating a new article.

You can reference the integration tests for creating and listing categories as a guide, post your tests to the discussions area or post a link to your GitHub repo.

Congratulations on completing section 7!
