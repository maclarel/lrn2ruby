To deploy your application to heroku, first ensure you have checked git status and that all your changes have been committed to your git repo. If there are untracked/uncommitted changes then follow the usual commit route:

$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Appropriate commit message"
$ git push origin master # to deploy to your GitHub or other code repo
Then deploy your changes to heroku and run any pending migrations there:

$ git push heroku master
.....after deployment completes successfully....
$ heroku run rails db:migrate
