You can find the blog post to add Bootstrap and it's dependencies in your application here: https://www.mashrurhossain.com/blog/rails6bootstrap4

Remember to update version 4.3.1 to whatever Bootstrap version you want to use. (In the post it's 4.3.1, in the video I used 4.4.1)

You can find all the code changes I made in this video here: https://github.com/udemyrailscourse/alpha-blog-6/commit/3cf2925664761c697c156ecf7687721086071adc

You can ignore the changes in the package.json and yarn.lock files in the commit since they are done automatically during the installation process.

The code added to make your app understand jquery and popper extensions in the config/webpack/environment.js file is listed below:

const webpack = require("webpack")
environment.plugins.append("Provide", new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
  $: 'jquery',
  jQuery: 'jquery',
  Popper: ['popper.js', 'default']
}))
