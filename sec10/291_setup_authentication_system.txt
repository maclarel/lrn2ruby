First add the following gems to the gemfile:

gem 'devise'

gem 'twitter-bootstrap-rails'

gem 'devise-bootstrap-views'

If using Rails 5, also add gem 'jquery-rails'

Then run bundle install --without production

Then install devise:

rails generate devise:install

rails generate devise User

Pull up the migration file that just got created and uncomment the 4 lines under confirmable:

t.string :confirmation_token

t.datetime :confirmed_at

t.datetime :confirmation_sent_at

t.string :unconfirmed_email

Pull up the user.rb model file under app/models and in the line for devise, add in a:

:confirmable,

after :registerable, entry

Run your migration now to create the users table:

rake db:migrate (rails db:migrate if using Rails 5)

In your application_controller.rb file under app/controllers add in:

before_action :authenticate_user!

In your welcome_controller.rb file under app/controllers add in:

skip_before_action :authenticate_user!, only: [:index]

Run the following generators to install bootstrap themed styling:

rails generate bootstrap:install static

rails generate bootstrap:layout application # select Y to force override after hitting enter

rails generate devise:views:locale en

rails generate devise:views:bootstrap_templates

In the application.css file under app/assets/stylesheets folder, right above the line that says *= require_tree add in the following line:

*= require devise_bootstrap_views
  - This broken things in Rails 6, removed for now

If using Rails 5, you need to perform the following two steps:

- Remove the favicon link tags from application.html.erb layout file (there should be 5)
  - I had to do this in Rails 6 as well

- In the application.js file under app/assets/javascripts folder, add the line //= require jquery to make it look like below:

//= require rails-ujs
//= require jquery
//= require twitter/bootstrap
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
