NOTE that these steps involving sendgrid have been skipped as they require adding a credit card to Heroku. Unfortunately this means I need to skip all production (Heroku) deployments of this app, as with MessageMe.


First add in your credit card details to your heroku account

Then enter in:

heroku addons:create sendgrid:starter

Set the sendgrid apikey credentials you created for heroku:

heroku config:set SENDGRID_USERNAME=apikey

heroku config:set SENDGRID_PASSWORD=enterintheapikey

To display your settings you can type in:

heroku config:get SENDGRID_USERNAME

Open your .profile file and enter in the following as well, if using a different environment, check discussions/google/docs or your environment's settings help/doc for more info about where you can set this:

export SENDGRID_USERNAME=apikey

export SENDGRID_PASSWORD=entireapikey

Then open a new terminal window for these to take effect

Under config/environment.rb file add in the following code at the bottom:

ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {

:address => 'smtp.sendgrid.net',

:port => '587',

:authentication => :plain,

:user_name => ENV['SENDGRID_USERNAME'],

:password => ENV['SENDGRID_PASSWORD'],

:domain => 'heroku.com',

:enable_starttls_auto => true

}

Now update the development.rb file under config/environments folder and add the following two lines:

config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :test

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'http://previewurlforyourapp'}

My preview url looks like this: http://ruby-on-rails-123170.nitrousapp.com:3000

Now update the production.rb file under config/environments folder and add the following two lines:

config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'yourherokuappname.herokuapp.com', :protocol => 'https'}

Test it out in development by signing up a user and then grabbing the confirmation link from the web output in your terminal and copying/pasting the link in your browser
